    <h1>HOUR OF CODE EVENT!</h1>
    <p class="eventinfo">As 1st-year students at ADA University Gulay Mehraliyeva, Sama Umudaliyeva, Jala Garayeva, and Rashad Khalilli(Team 44), we implemented the #HourOfCode international project at the Baku Physics, Mathematics, and Informatics Lyceum on November 3, 2023. At the event, we taught students the basics of coding by building algorithms through the Code.org website. The projectâ€™s main goal was to show that anyone can write code in fun ways, and we tried to motivate them to increase their interest in the field of computer science. At the end of the event, all students were awarded certificates for their active participation. 
        We express our deep gratitude to the school administration of the Baku Physics, Mathematics, and Informatics Lyceum, and my teacher Rita Jabbarova for her special attention in creating conditions for us to implement this project.You can see pictures and interesting videos about our event!
